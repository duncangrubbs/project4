### Aman Shrestha: Information Architect

This website is going to be about top tech companies. The website will give information about these companies including location, headquarter, CEO, Founder and important dates. In addition to this, the website will also have information about the type of company, what their main products are, what industry they operate in and what their history is. In this way, the website would be a helpful source to find a collection of information about top tech companies. 


We added a brief description of the company in the industry section of the taxonomy.
We also added more information about Headquarter for each company including location, area and some specific information.
