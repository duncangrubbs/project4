## About
This website is going to be about the top tech companies. The website will give information about these companies including headquarters, CEO, founder(s) and important historical dates. In addition to this, the website will also have information about the type of company, what their main products are, what industry they operate in and what their history is. In this way, the website would be a helpful source to find a collection of information about top tech companies. 

## Edits
We deviated from our original plan in a few ways. We added a brief description of the company in the industry section of the taxonomy. We also added more information about headquarters for each company including location, area and some specific information.

We changed the color scheme to include a gradient, this way the website didn't feel like vanilla bootstrap.

Finally, we added data tables to each company page, which weren't in the original design for our company pages. We felt that these were most suiting to show the company's products.
