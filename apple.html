            <h3>Headquarters</h3>
            <b>Mountain View, California, USA</b>
            <p>
              Apple Park is the corporate headquarters of Apple Inc., located at One Apple Park Way in Cupertino, California, United States. It was opened to employees in April 2017, while construction was still underway, and superseded the original headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, which opened in 1993.
              The main building's scale and circular groundscraper design, by Norman Foster, have earned the structure a media nickname â€œthe spaceship". Located on a suburban site totaling 175 acres (71 hectares), it houses more than 12,000 employees in one central four-story circular building of approximately 2,800,000 square feet (260,000 square meters). Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the campus to look less like an office park and more like a nature refuge. Eighty percent of the site consists of green space planted with drought-resistant trees and plants indigenous to the Cupertino area, and the center courtyard of the main building features an artificial pond.
              Apple Park is located 1.2 miles east of the original Apple Campus. Apple has had a presence in Cupertino since 1977, which is why the company decided to build in the area rather than move to a cheaper, distant location.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <!-- 239 words -->
            <p>
                Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976, and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977, in Cupertino, California.
                For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the Apple II, Macintosh, and Power Mac lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. 
                Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1997 after his company NeXT was bought by Apple.  The following year he became the company's interim CEO, which later became permanent. 
                Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design, starting with the original iMac in 1998.
                With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in 2001 and iTunes Music Store in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007. 
                The company is now also known for its iOS range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone, followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad. As of 30 June 2015, Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the 
                world by market capitalization, with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018. 
                Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011 and $156 billion in 2012.
