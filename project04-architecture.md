# Choreography

## Displaying List of companies
For displaying list of companies, depending on the number of companies, we will try to use **category** by making use of Industry. If there are fewer, we will try to use the type (public/private) as category.

For listing the companies themselves, we will use **Alphabetic** structure so that we don't present any company as better than the other. 

## Homepage

The homepage would have a slideshow of logos of the company with the photo of headquarter as a background.

Each slideshow would have a button to learn more about the company. 


## Within each company

Information in a company's page would be in a **categorical structure**. 

We start with the name, logo and headquarters. Then have a short description of the company which would have the Industry details. Then we would display the history of the company.
